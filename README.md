# Ortalab Mod Demo

## Description
Every action has an opposite reaction. In another world, in the nation of "Virtue", a simple indie developer created Ortalab, which so happened to be the opposite of our world's Balatro. This mod is intended to port everything from that parallel world to Balatro. Within this demo, it includes 40 Jokers and 3 decks for you to check out.

## How to Install
This mod requires the [Steamodded Mod loader](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) ver. 0.9.5 or higher. Download the zip file of newest release, and copy the `ReverseBalatro` file into `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods`, and launch the game.
